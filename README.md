## The game
Users login in a create a new game. A secret word is selected at random from the pool of words. 
A user must indicate the game difficulty during game creation.
For each attempt, an accuracy is returned which gives the user a hint of how far or close their guess is to the secret word. 

For example
you search for lions

the user send lotor
you send 10x0x

Where x is not good
and 1 is good
and 0 is not at the right position


The word pool can only be added to by the admin
